# Wazuh
Wazuh is a free, open-source security platform that helps monitor systems, detect threats, and protect against attacks. 
Wazuh works like a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool â€” collecting logs, checking for intrusions, monitoring files, and giving alerts through a dashboard.
